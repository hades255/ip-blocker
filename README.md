Development Requirements for IP Blocker Application
The development requirements for an IP Blocker Application, which will provide website owners with an easy-to-use platform to secure their websites by blocking malicious IP addresses, bots, unwanted countries, and even specific devices and browsers. The tool will also provide essential monitoring and reporting features to help users track traffic and ensure optimal website performance.
Below is a detailed overview of the application’s features and functionality, including the core elements required for development and free sources to be used wherever possible:
________________________________________
1.	Block Countries (Limit to 20)
The application will allow users to block access to their website from up to 20 specific countries. Users can select countries from a predefined list, and the system will automatically prevent users from these regions from accessing the website.
• Free Source: Use GeoLite2 from MaxMind for geolocation data. MaxMind offers a free database that can be used to detect and block IP addresses from specific countries.

2.	Detect Bots
The application should be able to automatically detect bot traffic using predefined algorithms and AI technology. Bots can sometimes appear as legitimate visitors, so the tool will need to accurately distinguish between human visitors and bots, thereby blocking them from accessing the site.
• Free Source: Bot detection can be performed using the free version of Distil Networks or Project Honey Pot for bot tracking.

3.	Block IP Addresses (Limit to 200 Monthly)
Users will have the ability to block up to 200 IP addresses per month. Once this limit is reached, users will receive a notification to inform them, and they will need to wait until the following month or upgrade the plan to unblock more IPs.
• Free Source: IPinfo.io offers a free API that allows you to query IP addresses for details such as location and usage.

4.	Count Same IP Addresses Visits
To ensure website traffic is legitimate, the system should track how often the same IP address visits the site. If an IP address visits too frequently, the system will alert the user, providing them the option to take action (such as blocking that IP).
• Free Source: You can track IP visits and analyze patterns using Google Analytics or store the data in a local database and use custom logic to identify frequent visits.
Google Analytics
5.	Show Total Visits to the Site
The application will provide a dashboard that displays an overview of total visits to the website, including the number of unique visits and repeat visits. This will help users understand the traffic patterns on their website and spot any unusual activity.
• Free Source: Google Analytics or Matomo (formerly Piwik) can be used for real-time and historical traffic analysis.

6.	Directly Connect Website with the Platform Without Any Tag Management
The core goal of this application is to make it extremely easy for users to connect their website. Users will be able to connect their website simply by entering the domain name or linking to their Google Analytics account, without requiring any complex tag management or additional setup.
• Free Source: Google Analytics API can be used to integrate website data seamlessly.

7.	Block Devices and Browsers
In addition to blocking IP addresses and countries, users will have the option to block specific devices or browsers. This feature is essential for preventing access from non-browser devices or outdated/unsupported browsers that could pose security risks.
• Free Source: DeviceDetector (open-source) can detect devices and browsers from user-agent strings.

8.	Dashboard to Show All Activities and Summary of Visits and User Activities
The dashboard will serve as the central hub for users, showing a comprehensive summary of website activity. It will include detailed statistics on:
o	Total visits
o	Visits from blocked countries or IPs
o	Detected bot traffic
o	Number of visits from the same IP
o	Any other suspicious or malicious activity
• Free Source: For building dashboards, you can use Google Data Studio or open-source libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

9.	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Users
Given the sensitive nature of this application, it is crucial to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). This will ensure that only authorized users can access and manage their settings on the platform.
• Free Source: Use Auth0 or Firebase Authentication, which provide free tiers for MFA.

10.	Single Account (One Website or One Account at a Time)
To avoid misuse and to streamline the user experience, we will allow users to connect only one website or one account at a time.
11.	Single Package for All (One-Time Buy)
We will offer a one-time purchase model for users, where they can pay for the full package upfront, rather than having a subscription or recurring payments. This package will provide access to all features, and users will have everything they need without worrying about additional costs.
12.	User Guide Page
The application will come with a user guide page that explains how users can easily connect their website with the platform, as well as detailed troubleshooting instructions. This will empower users to manage their site protection without needing constant support.
13.	Admin Panel “CRM” for Client Management
The admin panel will allow administrators to monitor all platform activities, manage clients, and oversee any actions taken by users.
• Free Source: Use AdminLTE (open-source admin panel template) or React Admin to build the admin dashboard.

14.	Payment Gateway Integration
To facilitate the one-time purchase model, we will need to integrate a secure payment gateway. This will be a paid integration, but free open-source alternatives such as Stripe can be considered for processing payments (API use is free, but a small fee applies to each transaction).
• Paid Source: Stripe, PayPal

15.	Load Testing
We want to ensure the platform can handle high volumes of traffic, especially if it grows in popularity. Load testing should be conducted to ensure scalability and performance under heavy use.
• Free Source: Use Apache JMeter (open-source tool) for load testing.
JMeter
16.	Email Notifications
To keep users informed, the platform will send email notifications about key events, such as:
•	IP blocks
•	Bot traffic detection
•	Website visits
•	Alerts when limits (country/IP blocks) are reached
•	Monthly summary reports
Users should also be able to customize their email notification preferences.
• Free Source: Use SendGrid for sending email notifications (free tier available).

17.	Front-End Website Design
The front-end design of the IP Blocker application should be clean, intuitive, and responsive. The user interface should provide an easy-to-navigate experience for users while maintaining a professional appearance. The design must allow users to interact with the dashboard, configure settings, view analytics, and access other features seamlessly. The layout should be mobile-friendly to ensure usability on different devices.
• Free Source: Use Bootstrap (open-source front-end framework) or Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework) for responsive and customizable web design.
